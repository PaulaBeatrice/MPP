This project encompasses the development of a triathlon contest application, realized through implementations in both C# and Java programming languages. The technological framework employed includes Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) facilitated by Hibernate. The architectural design adheres to a client-server model, ensuring scalability and robustness in handling concurrent user interactions. Furthermore, the project incorporates a cross-platform client-server communication paradigm leveraging Protocol Buffers. Additionally, the application integrates REST services.
